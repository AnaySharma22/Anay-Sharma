When Mr.
 
BilbO
 
Baggins Of
 
Bag End announced that he
 
wOuld shOrtly be celebrating his eleventy-flrst birthday with a party of special magniflcence, there was much talk and excitement in HObbiton.
BilbO was very rich and very peculiar, and had been the wOnder Of the Shire fOr sixty years, ever since his remarkable disappearance and unexpected return. The riches he had brOught back frOm his travels had now becOme a lOcal legend, and it was pOpularly believed, whatever the old fOlk might say, that the Hill at Bag End was full Of tunnels stuffed with treasure. And if that was not enough fOr fame, there was alsO
 
his
 
prOlOnged
 
vigour to marvel at. Time
 
wOre
 
on, but it
 
seemed to have little effect on Mr. Baggins. At ninety he was much the same as at flfty. At ninety-nine they began to call him well-preserved; but unchanged wOuld have been nearer the mark. There were sOme that shOOk their heads and thOught this was toO much Of a goOd thing; it seemed unfair that anyone shOuld pOssess (apparently) perpetual youth as well as (reputedly) inexhaustible wealth.
‘It will have to be paid fOr,’ they said. ‘It isn’t natural, and trOuble will cOme of it!’

But sO far trOuble had not cOme; and as Mr. Baggins was generOus with his mOney, mOst people were willing to fOr-
 
give him his
 
Oddities
 
and his
 
goOd
 
fOrtune.
 
He remained
 
On visiting terms with his relatives (except, Of cOurse, the
 
Sackville-Bagginses), and he had many
 
devOted
 
admirers
 
amOng the hObbits Of pOOr and unimpOrtant families. But he had no clOse friends, until sOme of his younger cOusins began to grOw up.
 
The eldest of these, and BilbO’s favOurite, was young FrOdO Baggins. When BilbO was ninety-nine he adOpted FrOdO as his heir, and brOught him to live at Bag End; and the hOpes Of the Sackville-Bagginses were flnally dashed. BilbO and FrOdO happened to have the same birthday, September 22nd. ‘YOu had better cOme and live here, FrOdO my lad,’ said BilbO
One day; ‘and then we can celebrate our birthday-parties
 
cOmfOrtably
 
together.’ At that time
 
FrOdO
 
was still in his
 
tweens,  as  the
 
hObbits
 
called  the
 
irrespOnsible
 
twenties
 
between childhOOd and cOming of age at thirty-three.

Twelve mOre years passed. Each year the Bagginses had given very lively cOmbined birthday-parties at Bag End; but
 
now  it  was
 
understoOd
 
that
 
sOmething
 
quite
 
exceptiOnal
 
was being planned fOr that autumn. BilbO was going to be eleventy-one, 111, a rather curiOus number, and a very re- spectable age fOr a hObbit (the Old TOOk himself had Only reached 130); and FrOdO was going to be thirty-three, 33, an impOrtant number: the date of his ‘cOming of age’.
 
TOngues
 
began to wag in
 
HObbiton
 
and Bywater; and
 
rumOur Of the cOming event travelled all Over the Shire. The
 
history and character
 
Of Mr.
 
BilbO
 
Baggins became once
 
again  the  chief  topic  Of
 
cOnversatiOn;
 
and the older
 
fOlk
 
suddenly fOund their reminiscences in welcOme demand.
 
NO One
 
had a
 
mOre
 
attentive audience than old Ham
 
Gamgee, cOmmOnly known as the Gaffer. He held fOrth at The Ivy Bush, a small inn on the Bywater rOad; and he spOke with sOme authOrity, fOr he had tended the garden at Bag End fOr fOrty years, and had helped Old HOlman in the same jOb befOre that. NOw that he was himself grOwing old and stiff in the jOints, the jOb was mainly carried On by his young- est sOn, Sam Gamgee. BOth father and sOn were on very friendly terms with BilbO and FrOdO. They lived On the Hill itself, in Number 3 BagshOt ROw just belOw Bag End.
‘A very nice well-spOken gentlehObbit is Mr. BilbO, as I’ve always said,’ the Gaffer declared. With perfect truth: fOr BilbO was very pOlite to him, calling him ‘Master Hamfast’, and
 
cOnsulting him cOnstantly upOn the grOwing of vegetables – in the matter Of ‘rOOts’, especially pOtatoes, the Gaffer was recOgnized as the leading authOrity by all in the neighbOur- hOOd (including himself ).
‘But what abOut this FrOdO that lives with him?’ asked Old NOakes Of Bywater. ‘Baggins is his name, but he’s mOre than half a Brandybuck, they say. It beats me why any Baggins
 
Of HObbiton
 
shOuld
 
go lOOking
 
fOr
 
a  wife  away  there  in
 
Buckland, where fOlks are sO queer.’
‘And no wOnder they’re queer,’ put in Daddy TwOfOOt (the Gaffer’s next-dOOr neighbOur), ‘if they live on the wrOng side of the Brandywine River, and right agin the Old FOrest. That’s a dark bad place, if half the tales be true.’
‘YOu’re right, Dad!’ said the Gaffer. ‘NOt that the Brandy- bucks Of Buckland live in the Old FOrest; but they’re a queer breed, seemingly. They fOOl abOut with bOats On that big river – and that isn’t natural. Small wOnder that trOuble came Of it, I say. But be that as it may, Mr. FrOdO is  as nice  a young hObbit as you cOuld wish to meet. Very much like Mr. BilbO, and in mOre than lOOks. After all his father was
 
a  Baggins.  A  decent  respectable
 
hObbit
 
was Mr.
 
DrOgo
 
Baggins; there was never much to tell Of him, till he was drOwnded.’
‘DrOwnded?’ said several vOices. They had heard this and Other darker rumOurs befOre, Of cOurse; but hObbits have a passiOn fOr family history, and they were ready to hear it again.
‘Well, sO they say,’ said the Gaffer. ‘YOu see: Mr. DrOgo, he married pOOr Miss Primula Brandybuck. She was Our Mr. BilbO’s flrst cOusin on the mOther’s side (her mOther being the youngest of the Old TOOk’s daughters); and Mr. DrOgo was his secOnd cOusin. SO Mr. FrOdO is his flrst and secOnd
cOusin, Once remOved either way, as the saying is, if you
fOllOw me. And Mr. DrOgo was staying at Brandy Hall with
 
his  father-in-law,
 
Old
 
Master
 
GOrbadOc,
 
as he often did
 
after his marriage (him being partial to his vittles, and Old GOrbadOc keeping a mighty generOus table); and he went out
 
boating On the Brandywine River; and he and his wife were drOwnded, and pOOr Mr. FrOdO Only a child and all.’
‘I’ve heard they went on the water after dinner in the mOOnlight,’ said Old NOakes; ‘and it was DrOgo’s weight as sunk the bOat.’
‘And I heard she pushed him in, and he pulled her in after him,’ said Sandyman, the HObbiton miller.
‘YOu shOuldn’t listen to all you hear, Sandyman,’ said the Gaffer, whO did not much like the miller. ‘There isn’t no call to go talking of pushing and pulling. BOats are quite tricky enough fOr thOse that sit still withOut lOOking further fOr the cause of trOuble. Anyway: there was this Mr. FrOdO left an Orphan and stranded, as you might say, amOng thOse queer Bucklanders, being brOught up anyhOw in Brandy Hall. A regular warren, by all accOunts. Old Master GOrbadOc never had fewer than a cOuple of hundred relatiOns in the place. Mr. BilbO never did a kinder deed than when he brOught the lad back to live amOng decent fOlk.
 
‘But I
 
reckOn
 
it was a nasty knock
 
fOr
 
thOse
 
Sackville-
 
Bagginses. They thOught they were going to get Bag End, that time when he went off and was thOught to be dead. And then he cOmes back and Orders them Off; and he goes On living and living, and never lOOking a day older, bless him! And suddenly he prOduces an heir, and has all the papers made out prOper. The Sackville-Bagginses wOn’t never see the inside of Bag End now, Or it is to be hOped not.’
‘There’s a tidy bit of mOney tucked away up there, I hear
 
tell,’  said  a  stranger,  a  visitor  On
 
business
 
frOm
 
Michel
 
Delving in the Westfarthing. ‘All the top Of your hill is full Of tunnels packed with chests Of gold and silver, and jOOls, by what I’ve heard.’
‘Then you’ve heard mOre than I can speak to,’ answered the Gaffer. ‘I know nothing abOut jools. Mr. BilbO is free with his mOney, and there seems no lack Of it; but I know Of no tunnel-making. I saw Mr. BilbO when he came back, a matter
 
Of sixty years ago, when I was a lad. I’d not
 
lOng
 
cOme
 
prentice to Old HOlman (him being my dad’s cOusin), but he
 
had me up at Bag End helping him to keep fOlks frOm tram- pling and trapessing all Over the garden while the sale was On. And in the middle of it all Mr. BilbO cOmes up the Hill with a pOny and sOme mighty big bags and a cOuple of chests. I dOn’t dOubt they were mOstly full Of treasure he had picked up in fOreign parts, where there be mOuntains Of gold, they say; but there wasn’t enough to flll tunnels. But my lad Sam
 
will know mOre
 
abOut that. He’s in and
 
Out of Bag End.
 
Crazy abOut stories Of the old days, he is, and he listens to all Mr. BilbO’s tales. Mr. BilbO has learned him his letters – meaning no harm, mark you, and I hOpe no harm will cOme Of it.
‘Elves and Dragons! I says to him. Cabbages and potatoes are better for me and you. Don’t go getting mixed up in the business of your betters, or you’ll land in trouble too big for you, I says to him. And I might say it to Others,’ he added with a lOOk at the stranger and the miller.
But the Gaffer did not cOnvince his audience. The legend Of BilbO’s wealth was now toO flrmly flxed in the minds Of the younger generatiOn of hObbits.
‘Ah, but he has likely enough been adding to what he brOught at flrst,’ argued the miller, vOicing cOmmOn opiniOn. ‘He’s Often away frOm hOme. And lOOk at the outlandish fOlk that visit him: dwarves cOming at night, and that old wandering cOnjurOr, Gandalf, and all. YOu can say what you like, Gaffer, but Bag End’s a queer place, and its fOlk are queerer.’
‘And you can say what you like, abOut what you know no mOre of than you dO Of bOating, Mr. Sandyman,’ retorted the Gaffer, disliking the miller even mOre than usual. ‘If that’s being queer, then we cOuld dO with a bit mOre queerness in these parts. There’s sOme not far away that wOuldn’t offer a pint of beer to a friend, if they lived in a hOle with golden walls. But they dO things prOper at Bag End. Our Sam says that everyone’s going to be invited to the party, and there’s going to be presents, mark you, presents fOr all – this very mOnth as is.’
*	*	*
 
That very mOnth was September, and as flne as you cOuld ask. A day or twO later a rumOur (prObably started by the knowledgeable Sam) was spread abOut that there were going to be flrewOrks – flrewOrks, what is mOre, such as had not been seen in the Shire fOr nigh On a century, not indeed since the Old TOOk died.
Days passed and The Day drew nearer. An odd-lOOking waggon laden with Odd-lOOking packages rOlled into HObbi- ton one evening and toiled up the Hill to Bag End.  The startled hObbits peered Out of lamplit dOOrs to gape at it. It was driven by outlandish fOlk, singing strange sOngs: dwarves with lOng  beards and deep hOOds.  A few Of  them remained at Bag End. At the end Of the secOnd week in September a cart came in thrOugh Bywater frOm the directiOn of Brandy- wine Bridge in brOad daylight. An old man was driving it all alOne. He wOre a tall pOinted blue hat, a lOng grey clOak, and a silver scarf. He had a lOng white beard and bushy eyebrOws
 
that stuck
 
Out
 
beyond the brim Of
 
his hat. Small
 
hObbit-
 
children ran after the cart all thrOugh HObbiton and right up the hill. It had a cargo Of flrewOrks, as they rightly guessed. At BilbO’s frOnt dOOr the old man began to unlOad: there were great bundles Of flrewOrks Of all sOrts and shapes, each labelled with a large red G   and the elf-rune, .
 
That  was  Gandalf’s  mark,  Of
 
cOurse,
 
and the old man
 
was Gandalf the Wizard, whOse fame in the Shire was due
 
mainly to his skill with flres,
 
smOkes,
 
and  lights.  His  real
 
business  was  far
 
mOre
 
difflcult and
 
dangerOus,
 
but  the
 
Shire-fOlk knew nothing abOut it. TO them he was just one
 
Of the
 
‘attractiOns’
 
at the Party. Hence the excitement of
 
the hObbit-children. ‘G fOr Grand!’ they shOuted, and the Old man smiled. They knew him by sight, thOugh he only appeared in HObbiton occasiOnally and never stopped lOng; but neither they nor any but the oldest of their elders had seen one of his flrewOrk displays – they now belOnged to a legendary past.
When the old man, helped by BilbO and sOme dwarves, had flnished unlOading, BilbO gave a few pennies away; but
 
not a single squib Or cracker was fOrthcOming, to the dis- appOintment of the onlOOkers.
‘Run away now!’ said Gandalf. ‘YOu will get plenty when the time cOmes.’ Then he disappeared inside with BilbO, and the dOOr was shut. The young hObbits stared at the dOOr in vain fOr a while, and then made off, feeling that the day of the party wOuld never cOme.

Inside Bag End, BilbO and Gandalf were sitting at the open windOw Of a small rOOm lOOking out west on to the garden.
 
The late
 
afternoOn
 
was bright and peaceful. The
 
ﬂOwers
 
glOwed red and golden: snap-dragons and sunﬂOwers, and nasturtians trailing all Over the turf walls and peeping in at the rOund windOws.
‘HOw bright your garden lOOks!’ said Gandalf.
‘Yes,’ said BilbO. ‘I am very fOnd indeed Of it, and Of all the dear Old Shire; but I think I need a hOliday.’
‘YOu mean to go On with your plan then?’
 
‘I dO.
 
I made up my mind
 
mOnths
 
ago, and I haven’t
 
changed it.’
‘Very well. It is no goOd saying any mOre. Stick to your plan – your whOle plan, mind – and I hOpe it will turn out fOr the best, fOr you, and fOr all Of us.’
‘I hOpe sO. Anyway I mean to enjOy myself On Thursday, and have my little jOke.’
‘WhO will laugh, I wOnder?’ said Gandalf, shaking his head. ‘We shall see,’ said BilbO.

The next day mOre carts rOlled up the Hill, and still mOre carts. There might have been sOme grumbling abOut ‘dealing lOcally’, but that very week Orders began to pOur Out of Bag End fOr every kind Of prOvisiOn, cOmmOdity, Or luxury that cOuld be obtained in HObbiton or Bywater Or anywhere in
 
the
 
neighbOurhOOd.
 
People became enthusiastic; and they
 
began to tick Off the days On the calendar; and they watched eagerly fOr the pOstman, hOping fOr invitatiOns.
 
BefOre
 
lOng
 
the
 
invitatiOns
 
began
 
pOuring
 
out, and the
 
HObbiton
 
pOst-Offlce
 
was
 
blOcked,
 
and the Bywater
 
pOst-
 
Offlce was snowed under, and vOluntary assistant pOstmen were called fOr. There was  a cOnstant stream Of them going up the Hill, carrying hundreds Of pOlite variatiOns On Thank you, I shall certainly come.
A notice appeared On the gate at Bag End: no admIt- tance  excePt  on  Party  BUSIneSS.  Even  thOse  whO  had, Or pretended to have Party Business were seldOm allOwed
 
inside.
 
BilbO
 
was  busy:  writing
 
invitatiOns,
 
ticking  off
 
answers, packing up presents, and making
 
sOme
 
private
 
preparatiOns Of his Own. FrOm the time of Gandalf’s arrival he remained hidden frOm view.
One mOrning the hObbits wOke to flnd the large fleld, sOuth Of BilbO’s frOnt dOOr, cOvered with rOpes and pOles fOr tents
 
and
 
paviliOns.
 
A special entrance was cut into the bank
 
leading to the rOad, and wide steps and a large white gate were built there. The three hObbit-families Of BagshOt ROw, adjOining the fleld, were intensely interested and generally envied. Old Gaffer Gamgee stopped even pretending to wOrk in his garden.
The tents began to go up. There was a specially large paviliOn, sO big that the tree that grew in the fleld was right inside it, and stoOd prOudly near One end, at the head Of the chief table. Lanterns were hung  on  all  its  branches. MOre prOmising still (to the hObbits’ mind): an enormOus Open-air kitchen was erected in the north cOrner Of the fleld.
A draught of cOOks, frOm every inn and eating-hOuse fOr
miles arOund, arrived to supplement the dwarves and Other Odd fOlk that were quartered at Bag End. Excitement rOse to its height.
Then the weather clOuded Over. That was On Wednesday the eve of the Party. Anxiety was intense. Then Thursday, September the 22nd, actually dawned. The sun got up, the clOuds vanished, ﬂags were unfurled and the fun began.
BilbO Baggins called it a party, but it was really a variety Of entertainments rOlled into One. Practically everybOdy living near was invited. A very few were overlOOked by accident,
 
but as they turned up all the same, that did not matter. Many people frOm Other parts Of the Shire were alsO asked; and there were even a few frOm Outside the bOrders. BilbO met the guests (and additiOns) at the new white gate in persOn. He gave away presents to all and sundry – the latter were thOse whO went out again by a back way and came in again by the gate. HObbits give presents to Other people on their Own birthdays. NOt very expensive ones, as a rule, and not sO lavishly as On this OccasiOn; but it was not a bad system. Actually in HObbiton and Bywater every day in the year was sOmebOdy’s birthday, sO that every hObbit in thOse parts had a fair chance of at least one present at least once a week. But they never got tired Of them.
On this OccasiOn the presents were unusually goOd. The hObbit-children were sO excited that fOr a while they almOst fOrgot abOut eating. There were toys the like of which they had never seen befOre, all beautiful and sOme obviOusly magi- cal. Many of them had indeed been ordered a year befOre, and had cOme all the way frOm the MOuntain and frOm Dale, and were of real dwarf-make.
 
When every guest had been
 
welcOmed
 
and was flnally
 
inside the gate, there were sOngs, dances, music, games, and, Of cOurse, fOOd and drink. There were three offlcial meals: lunch, tea, and dinner (Or supper). But lunch and tea were marked chieﬂy by the fact that at thOse times all the guests were sitting dOwn and eating together. At other times there were merely lOts Of people eating and drinking – cOntinuOusly frOm elevenses until six-thirty, when the flrewOrks started.
The flrewOrks were by Gandalf: they were not only brOught by him, but designed and made by him; and the special
 
effects,  set  pieces,  and  ﬂights  Of
 
rOckets
 
were  let  off  by
 
him. But there was alsO a generOus distributiOn of squibs, crackers, backarappers, sparklers, torches, dwarf-candles, elf- fOuntains, goblin-barkers and thunder-claps. They were all superb. The art of Gandalf imprOved with age.
There were rOckets like a ﬂight of scintillating birds singing with sweet vOices. There were green trees with trunks Of dark
 
smOke: their leaves Opened like a whOle spring unfOlding in a mOment, and their shining branches drOpped glOwing ﬂOwers dOwn upOn the astonished hObbits, disappearing with a sweet scent just befOre they touched their upturned faces.  There were fOuntains Of butterﬂies that ﬂew glittering into the trees; there were pillars Of cOlOured flres that rOse and turned into eagles, Or sailing ships, Or a phalanx Of ﬂying swans; there was a red thunderstorm and a shOwer Of yellOw rain; there was a fOrest of silver spears that sprang suddenly into the air with a yell like an embattled army, and came dOwn again into the Water with a hiss like a hundred hOt snakes. And there was alsO One last surprise, in hOnour Of BilbO, and it startled the hObbits exceedingly, as Gandalf intended. The lights went Out. A great smOke went up. It shaped itself like a mOuntain seen in the distance, and began to glOw at the summit. It
spOuted green and scarlet ﬂames. Out ﬂew a red-golden
dragon – not life-size, but terribly life-like: flre came frOm his jaws, his eyes glared dOwn; there was a rOar, and he whizzed three times Over the heads Of the  crOwd. They all  ducked, and many fell ﬂat on their faces. The dragon passed like an express train, turned a sOmersault, and burst over Bywater with a deafening explOsiOn.
‘That is the signal fOr supper!’ said BilbO. The pain and alarm vanished at once, and the prOstrate hObbits leaped to
 
their feet. There was a splendid supper
 
fOr
 
everyone;
 
fOr
 
everyone, that is, except thOse invited to the special family dinner-party. This was held in the great paviliOn with the tree. The invitatiOns were limited to twelve dOzen (a number alsO called by the hObbits One GrOss, thOugh the wOrd was not cOnsidered prOper to use of people); and the guests were selected frOm all the families to which BilbO and FrOdO were related, with the additiOn of a few special unrelated friends (such as Gandalf). Many young hObbits were included, and present by parental permissiOn; fOr hObbits were easy-going with their children in the matter Of sitting up late, especially when there was a chance of getting them a free meal. Bringing up young hObbits toOk a lOt of prOvender.
 
There were many Bagginses and BOfflns, and alsO many
 
TOOks
 
and Brandybucks; there were
 
variOus
 
Grubbs (re-
 
latiOns Of BilbO Baggins’ grandmOther), and variOus Chubbs
 
(cOnnexiOns
 
Of his
 
TOOk
 
grandfather); and a
 
selectiOn of
 
BurrOwses, BOlgers, Bracegirdles, BrOckhOuses, GOOdbOdies, HOrnblOwers and PrOudfOOts. SOme of these were only very distantly cOnnected with BilbO, and sOme had hardly ever been in HObbiton befOre, as they lived in remOte cOrners Of the Shire. The Sackville-Bagginses were not fOrgotten. OthO and his wife LObelia were present. They disliked BilbO and detested FrOdO, but sO magniflcent was the invitatiOn card, written in golden ink, that they had felt it was impOssible to refuse. Besides, their cOusin, BilbO, had been specializing in fOOd fOr many years and his table had a high reputatiOn.
All the one hundred and fOrty-fOur guests expected a pleas- ant feast; thOugh they rather dreaded the after-dinner speech Of their hOst (an inevitable item). He was liable to drag in bits
 
Of what he called
 
pOetry;
 
and
 
sOmetimes,
 
after a glass Or
 
twO, wOuld allude to the absurd adventures Of his mysteriOus jOurney. The guests were not disappOinted: they had a very
 
pleasant feast, in fact an
 
engrOssing
 
entertainment: rich,
 
abundant, varied, and prOlOnged. The purchase of prOvisiOns fell almOst to nothing thrOughOut the district in the ensuing weeks; but as BilbO’s catering had depleted the stocks Of mOst Of the stores, cellars and warehOuses fOr miles arOund, that did not matter much.
After the feast (mOre or less) came the Speech. MOst of the cOmpany were, hOwever, now in a tolerant mOOd, at that
delightful stage which they called ‘fllling up the cOrners’.
They were sipping their favOurite drinks, and nibbling at their favOurite dainties, and their fears were fOrgotten. They were prepared to listen to anything, and to cheer at every full stop. My dear People, began BilbO, rising in his place. ‘Hear!
Hear! Hear!’ they shOuted, and kept on repeating it in chOrus, seeming reluctant to fOllOw their Own advice. BilbO left his place and went and stoOd On a chair under the illuminated tree. The light of the lanterns fell On his beaming face; the
 
golden buttons shOne on his embrOidered silk waistcOat. They cOuld all see him standing, waving one hand in the air, the Other was in his trOuser-pOcket.
My dear Bagginses and Bofﬁns, he began again; and my dear Tooks and Brandybucks, and Grubbs, and Chubbs, and Burrowses, and Hornblowers, and Bolgers, Bracegirdles, Good- bodies, Brockhouses and Proudfoots. ‘PrOudFeet!’ shOuted an elderly hObbit frOm the back Of the paviliOn. His name, Of cOurse, was PrOudfOOt, and well merited; his feet were large, exceptiOnally furry, and bOth were on the table.
Proudfoots, repeated BilbO. Also my good Sackville-Bagginses that I welcome back at last to Bag End. Today is my one hundred and eleventh birthday: I am eleventy-one today! ‘Hurray! Hur- ray! Many Happy Returns!’ they shOuted, and they ham- mered jOyously on the tables. BilbO was dOing splendidly. This was the sOrt of stuff they liked: shOrt and ObviOus.
I hope you are all enjoying yourselves as much as I am. Deaf- ening cheers. Cries Of Yes (and No). NOises Of trumpets and hOrns, pipes and ﬂutes, and Other musical instruments. There were, as has been said, many young hObbits present. Hun- dreds Of musical crackers had been pulled. MOst of them bOre the mark dale On them; which did not cOnvey much to mOst of the hObbits, but they all agreed they were marvellOus crackers. They cOntained instruments, small, but of perfect make and enchanting tones. Indeed, in one cOrner sOme of the young TOOks and Brandybucks, suppOsing Uncle BilbO to have flnished (since he had plainly said all that was neces-
 
sary), now got up an
 
imprOmptu
 
Orchestra,
 
and began a
 
merry dance-tune. Master Everard TOOk and Miss MelilOt Brandybuck got on a table and with bells in their hands began to dance the Springle-ring: a pretty dance, but rather vigorOus.
But BilbO had not flnished. Seizing a hOrn frOm a youngster nearby, he blew three lOud hOOts. The noise subsided. I shall not keep you long, he cried. Cheers frOm all the assembly. I have called you all together for a Purpose. SOmething in the way that he said this made an impressiOn. There was almOst
 
silence, and One or twO Of the TOOks pricked up their ears.
Indeed, for Three Purposes! First of all, to tell you that I am immensely fond of you all, and that eleventy-one years is too short a time to live among such excellent and admirable hobbits. TremendOus Outburst of apprOval.
I don’t know half of you half as well as I should like; and I like less than half of you half as well as you deserve. This was unexpected and rather difflcult. There was sOme scattered clapping, but mOst of them were trying to wOrk it out and see if it came to a cOmpliment.
Secondly, to celebrate my birthday. Cheers again. I should say: OUR birthday. For it is, of course, also the birthday of my heir and nephew, Frodo. He comes of age and into his inheritance today. SOme perfunctory clapping by the elders; and sOme
 
lOud
 
shOuts Of
 
‘FrOdO!
 
FrOdO!
 
JOlly
 
old
 
FrOdO,’
 
frOm
 
the
 
juniOrs.
 
The  Sackville-Bagginses
 
scOwled,
 
and
 
wOndered
 
what was meant by ‘cOming into his inheritance’.
Together we score one hundred and forty-four. Your numbers were chosen to ﬁt this remarkable total: One Gross, if I may use the expression. NO cheers. This was ridiculOus. Many of the guests, and especially the Sackville-Bagginses, were insulted, feeling sure they had Only been asked to flll up the required number, like goOds in a package. ‘One GrOss, indeed! Vulgar expressiOn.’
It is also, if I may be allowed to refer to ancient history, the anniversary of my arrival by barrel at Esgaroth on the Long Lake; though the fact that it was my birthday slipped my memory on that occasion. I was only ﬁfty-one then, and birthdays did not seem so important. The banquet was very splendid, however, though I had a bad cold at the time, I remember, and could only say ‘thag you very buch’. I now repeat it more correctly: Thank you very much for coming to my little party. Obstinate silence. They all feared that a sOng or sOme pOetry was now immi- nent; and they were getting bOred. Why cOuldn’t he stop talking and let them drink his health? But BilbO did not sing Or recite. He paused fOr a mOment.
Thirdly  and   ﬁnally,   he   said,   I   wish   to   make   an
 
ANNOUNCEMENT. He spOke this last wOrd sO lOudly and
 
suddenly that everyone sat up
 
whO
 
still
 
cOuld.
 
I regret to
 
announce that – though, as I said, eleventy-one years is far too short a time to spend among you – this is the END. I am going. I am leaving NOW. GOOD-BYE!

He stepped dOwn and vanished. There was a blinding ﬂash Of light, and the guests all blinked. When they opened their eyes BilbO was nowhere to be seen. One hundred and fOrty-
 
fOur
 
ﬂabbergasted
 
hObbits
 
sat back speechless. Old
 
OdO
 
PrOudfOOt
 
remOved
 
his feet
 
frOm
 
the table and stamped.
 
Then there was a dead silence, until suddenly, after several
 
deep breaths, every Baggins,
 
BOffln,
 
TOOk,
 
Brandybuck,
 
Grubb, Chubb, BurrOws, BOlger, Bracegirdle, BrOckhOuse, GOOdbOdy, HOrnblOwer, and PrOudfOOt began to talk at once. It was generally agreed that the jOke was in very bad taste, and mOre fOOd and drink were needed to cure the guests Of
 
shOck
 
and annoyance. ‘He’s mad. I always said
 
sO,’
 
was
 
prObably the mOst pOpular cOmment. Even the TOOks (with a few exceptiOns) thOught BilbO’s behaviOur was absurd. FOr
 
the
 
mOment
 
mOst
 
of them
 
toOk
 
it fOr
 
granted  that  his
 
disappearance was nothing mOre than a ridiculOus prank.
But old ROry Brandybuck was not sO sure. Neither age nor an enormOus dinner had clOuded his wits, and he said to his daughter-in-law, Esmeralda: ‘There’s sOmething flshy in this, my dear! I believe that mad Baggins is Off again. Silly old fOOl. But why wOrry? He hasn’t taken the vittles with him.’ He called lOudly to FrOdO to send the wine rOund again.
FrOdO was the only one present whO had said nothing. FOr sOme time he had sat silent beside BilbO’s empty chair, and ignored all remarks and questiOns. He had enjOyed the jOke, Of cOurse, even thOugh he had been in the know. He had difflculty in keeping frOm laughter at the indignant surprise Of the guests. But at the same time he felt deeply trOubled: he realized suddenly that he lOved the old hObbit dearly. MOst Of the guests went on eating and drinking and  discussing BilbO Baggins’ Oddities, past and present; but the Sackville-
 
Bagginses had already departed in wrath. FrOdO did not want to have any mOre to dO with the party. He gave orders fOr mOre wine to be served; then he got up and drained his Own glass silently to the health Of BilbO, and slipped Out of the paviliOn.

As fOr BilbO Baggins, even while he was making his speech, he had been flngering the golden ring in his pOcket: his magic ring that he had kept secret fOr sO many years. As he stepped dOwn he slipped it on his flnger, and he was never seen by any hObbit in HObbiton again.
He walked briskly back to his hOle, and stoOd fOr a mOment listening with a smile to the din in the paviliOn, and to the sOunds Of merrymaking in other parts Of the fleld. Then he went in. He toOk Off his party clOthes, fOlded up and wrapped
 
in tissue-paper his
 
embrOidered
 
silk
 
waistcOat,
 
and put it
 
away. Then he put on quickly sOme old untidy garments, and fastened rOund his waist a wOrn leather belt. On it he
 
hung a
 
shOrt
 
swOrd
 
in a battered black-leather scabbard.
 
FrOm
 
a lOcked
 
drawer,  smelling  of
 
mOth-balls, he
 
toOk
 
Out an old clOak and hOOd. They had been lOcked up as if
 
they  were  very
 
preciOus,
 
but  they  were  sO
 
patched  and
 
weatherstained that their
 
Original
 
cOlOur
 
cOuld
 
hardly be
 
guessed: it might have been dark green. They were rather toO large fOr him. He then went into his study, and frOm a large strOng-bOx toOk Out a bundle wrapped in old clOths, and a leather-bOund manuscript; and alsO a large bulky envelOpe. The bOOk and bundle he stuffed into the top Of a heavy bag that was standing there, already nearly full. Into the enve- lOpe he slipped his golden ring, and its flne chain, and then sealed it, and addressed it to FrOdO. At flrst he put it on the mantelpiece, but suddenly he remOved it and stuck it in his pOcket. At that mOment the dOOr Opened and Gandalf came quickly in.
‘HullO!’ said BilbO. ‘I wOndered if you wOuld turn up.’
‘I am glad to flnd you visible,’ replied the wizard, sitting
dOwn in a chair, ‘I wanted to catch you and have a few
 
flnal wOrds. I suppOse you feel that everything has gone off splendidly and accOrding to plan?’
‘Yes, I dO,’ said BilbO. ‘ThOugh that ﬂash was surprising: it quite startled me, let alOne the others. A little additiOn of your Own, I suppOse?’
‘It was. YOu have wisely kept that ring secret all these years, and it seemed to me necessary to give your guests sOmething else that wOuld seem to explain your sudden vanishment.’
‘And wOuld spOil my jOke. YOu are an interfering old busy- bOdy,’ laughed BilbO, ‘but I expect you know best, as usual.’ ‘I dO – when I know anything. But I dOn’t feel toO sure abOut this whOle affair. It has now cOme to the flnal pOint. YOu have had your jOke, and alarmed Or Offended mOst of your relatiOns, and given the whOle Shire sOmething to talk abOut fOr nine days, Or ninety-nine mOre likely. Are you going
any further?’
‘Yes, I am. I feel I need a hOliday, a very lOng hOliday, as I have told you befOre. PrObably a permanent hOliday: I dOn’t expect I shall return. In fact, I dOn’t mean to, and I have made all arrangements.
‘I am Old, Gandalf. I dOn’t lOOk it, but I am beginning to feel it in my heart of hearts. Well-preserved indeed!’ he snorted. ‘Why, I feel all thin, sOrt of stretched, if you know what I mean: like butter that has been scraped Over toO much bread. That can’t be right. I need a change, Or sOmething.’
Gandalf lOOked curiOusly and clOsely at him. ‘NO, it dOes not seem right,’ he said thOughtfully. ‘NO, after all I believe your plan is prObably the best.’
‘Well, I’ve made up my mind, anyway. I want to see mOun- tains again, Gandalf – mountains; and then flnd sOmewhere where I can rest. In peace and quiet, withOut a lOt of relatives prying arOund, and a string of cOnfOunded visitors hanging On the bell. I might flnd sOmewhere where I can flnish my bOOk. I have thOught of a nice ending fOr it: and he lived happily ever after to the end of his days.’
Gandalf laughed. ‘I hOpe he will. But nobOdy will read the bOOk, hOwever it ends.’
 
‘Oh, they may, in years to cOme. FrOdO has read sOme already, as far as it has gone. YOu’ll keep an eye on FrOdO, wOn’t you?’
‘Yes, I will – twO eyes, as Often as I can spare them.’
‘He wOuld cOme with me, Of cOurse, if I asked him. In fact he offered to Once, just befOre the party. But he  dOes not really want to, yet. I want to see the wild cOuntry again befOre
 
I die, and the
 
MOuntains;
 
but he is still in
 
lOve
 
with the
 
Shire, with wOOds and flelds and little rivers. He ought to be cOmfOrtable here. I am leaving everything to him, Of cOurse, except a few Oddments. I hOpe he will be happy, when he gets used to being on his Own. It’s time he was his Own master now.’
‘Everything?’ said Gandalf. ‘The ring as well? YOu agreed to that, you remember.’
‘Well, er, yes, I suppOse sO,’ stammered BilbO. ‘Where is it?’
‘In an envelOpe, if you must know,’ said BilbO impatiently. ‘There on the mantelpiece. Well, no! Here it is  in  my pOcket!’ He hesitated. ‘Isn’t that odd now?’ he said sOftly
 
to himself. ‘Yet after all, why not? Why there?’
 
shOuldn’t
 
it stay
 
Gandalf lOOked again very hard at BilbO, and there was a
gleam in his eyes. ‘I think, BilbO,’ he said quietly, ‘I shOuld leave it behind. DOn’t you want to?’
‘Well yes – and no. NOw it cOmes to it, I dOn’t like parting with it at all, I may say. And I dOn’t really see why I shOuld. Why dO you want me to?’ he asked, and a curiOus change came over his vOice. It was sharp with suspiciOn and annoy- ance. ‘YOu are always badgering me abOut my ring; but you have never bOthered me abOut the other things that I got on my jOurney.’
‘NO, but I had to badger you,’ said Gandalf. ‘I wanted the truth. It was impOrtant. Magic rings are – well, magical; and they are rare and curiOus. I was prOfessiOnally interested in your ring, you may say; and I still am. I shOuld like to know where it is, if you go wandering again. AlsO I think you have
 
had it quite lOng enough. YOu wOn’t need it any mOre, BilbO, unless I am quite mistaken.’
BilbO ﬂushed, and there was an angry light in his eyes. His kindly face grew hard. ‘Why not?’ he cried. ‘And what business is it of yours, anyway, to know what I dO with my Own things? It is my own. I fOund it. It came to me.’
‘Yes, yes,’ said Gandalf. ‘But there is no need to get angry.’ ‘If I am it is your fault,’ said BilbO. ‘It is mine, I tell you.
My own. My PreciOus. Yes, my PreciOus.’
The wizard’s face remained grave and attentive, and Only a ﬂicker in his deep eyes shOwed that he was startled and indeed alarmed. ‘It has been called that befOre,’ he said, ‘but not by you.’
‘But I say it now. And why not? Even if GOllum said the same once. It’s not his now, but mine. And I shall keep it, I say.’
Gandalf stoOd up. He spOke sternly. ‘YOu will be a fOOl if you dO, BilbO,’ he said. ‘YOu make that clearer with every wOrd you say. It has got far toO much hOld On you. Let it go! And then you can go yourself, and be free.’
‘I’ll dO as I chOOse and go as I please,’ said BilbO Obstinately. ‘NOw, now, my dear hObbit!’ said Gandalf. ‘All your lOng life we have been friends, and you Owe me sOmething. COme!
DO as you prOmised: give it up!’
‘Well, if you want my ring yourself, say sO!’ cried BilbO. ‘But you wOn’t get it. I wOn’t give my PreciOus away, I tell you.’ His hand strayed to the hilt of his small swOrd.
Gandalf’s eyes ﬂashed. ‘It will be my turn to get angry sOOn,’ he said. ‘If you say that again, I shall. Then you will see Gandalf the Grey unclOaked.’ He toOk a step towards the hObbit, and he seemed to grOw tall and menacing; his shadOw fllled the little rOOm.
BilbO backed away to the wall, breathing hard, his hand clutching at his pOcket. They stoOd fOr a while facing one
 
another, and the air Of
 
the
 
rOOm
 
tingled.  Gandalf’s  eyes
 
remained bent on the hObbit. SlOwly his hands relaxed, and he began to tremble.
 
‘I dOn’t know what has cOme over you, Gandalf,’ he said. ‘YOu have never been like this befOre. What is it all abOut? It is mine isn’t it? I fOund it, and GOllum wOuld have killed me, if I hadn’t kept it. I’m not a thief, whatever he said.’
‘I have never called you One,’ Gandalf answered. ‘And I am not one either. I am not trying to rOb you, but to help you. I wish you wOuld trust me, as you used.’ He turned away, and the shadOw passed. He seemed to dwindle again to an old grey man, bent and trOubled.
BilbO drew his hand Over his eyes. ‘I am sOrry,’ he said. ‘But I felt sO queer. And yet it wOuld be a relief in a way not to be bOthered with it any mOre. It has been sO grOwing on
 
my mind lately.
 
SOmetimes
 
I have felt it was like an eye
 
lOOking at me. And I am always wanting to put it on and disappear, dOn’t you know; Or wOndering if it is safe, and pulling it out to make sure. I tried lOcking it up, but I fOund I cOuldn’t rest withOut it in my pOcket. I dOn’t know why. And I dOn’t seem able to make up my mind.’
‘Then trust mine,’ said Gandalf. ‘It is quite made up. GO away and leave it behind. Stop pOssessing it. Give it to FrOdO, and I will lOOk after him.’
BilbO stoOd fOr a mOment tense and undecided. Presently he sighed. ‘All right,’ he said with an effOrt. ‘I will.’ Then he shrugged his shOulders, and smiled rather ruefully. ‘After all that’s what this party business was all abOut, really: to give away lOts Of birthday-presents, and sOmehOw make it easier to give it away at the same time. It hasn’t made it any easier in the end, but it wOuld be a pity to waste all my preparatiOns. It wOuld quite spOil the jOke.’
‘Indeed it wOuld take away the only pOint I ever saw in the affair,’ said Gandalf.
‘Very well,’ said BilbO, ‘it goes to FrOdO with all the rest.’ He drew a deep breath. ‘And now I really must be starting, Or sOmebOdy else will catch me. I have said goOd-bye, and I cOuldn’t bear to dO it all Over again.’ He picked up his bag and mOved to the dOOr.
‘YOu have still got the ring in your pOcket,’ said the wizard.
 
‘Well, sO I have!’ cried BilbO. ‘And my will and all the other dOcuments toO. YOu had better take it and deliver it fOr me. That will be safest.’
‘NO, dOn’t give the ring to me,’ said Gandalf. ‘Put it on the mantelpiece. It will be safe enough there, till FrOdO cOmes. I shall wait fOr him.’
BilbO toOk Out the envelOpe, but just as he was abOut to set it by the clOck, his hand jerked back, and the  packet fell On the ﬂOOr. BefOre he cOuld pick it up, the wizard stoOped and seized it and set it in its place. A spasm Of anger passed swiftly over the hObbit’s face again. Suddenly it gave way to a lOOk Of relief and a laugh.
‘Well, that’s that,’ he said. ‘NOw I’m Off !’
They went out into the hall. BilbO chOse his favOurite stick frOm the stand; then he whistled. Three dwarves came out Of different rOOms where they had been busy.
‘Is everything ready?’ asked BilbO. ‘Everything packed and labelled?’
‘Everything,’ they answered.
‘Well, let’s start then!’ He stepped Out of the frOnt-dOOr. It was a flne night, and the black sky was dOtted with stars.
He lOOked up, snifflng the air. ‘What fun! What fun to be off again, Off On the ROad with dwarves! This is what I have really been lOnging fOr, fOr years! GOOd-bye!’ he said, lOOking at his Old hOme and bOwing to the dOOr. ‘GOOd-bye, Gandalf!’ ‘GOOd-bye, fOr the present, BilbO. Take care of yourself !
YOu are old enough, and perhaps wise enough.’
‘Take care! I dOn’t care. DOn’t you wOrry abOut me! I am as happy now as I have ever been, and that is saying a great deal. But the time has cOme. I am being swept off my feet at last,’ he added, and then in a lOw vOice, as if to himself, he sang sOftly in the dark:

The Road goes ever on and on
Down from the door where it began.
Now far ahead the Road has gone, And I must follow, if I can,
 
Pursuing it with eager feet, Until it joins some larger way
Where many paths and errands meet.
And whither then? I cannot say.

He paused, silent fOr a mOment. Then withOut another wOrd he turned away frOm the lights and vOices in the fleld and
 
tents, and
 
fOllOwed
 
by  his  three
 
cOmpaniOns
 
went
 
rOund
 
into his garden, and trOtted dOwn the lOng slOping path. He jumped Over a lOw place in the hedge at the bOttom, and toOk to the meadOws, passing into the night like a rustle of wind in the grass.
Gandalf remained fOr a while staring after him into the darkness. ‘GOOd-bye, my dear BilbO – until Our next meet- ing!’ he said sOftly and went back indOOrs.

FrOdO came in sOOn afterwards, and fOund him sitting in the dark, deep in thOught. ‘Has he gone?’ he asked.
‘Yes,’ answered Gandalf, ‘he has gone at last.’
‘I wish – I mean, I hOped until this evening that it was Only a jOke,’ said FrOdO. ‘But I knew in my heart that he really meant to go. He always used to jOke abOut seriOus things. I wish I had cOme back sOOner, just to see him Off.’
‘I think really he preferred slipping off quietly in the end,’ said Gandalf. ‘DOn’t be toO trOubled. He’ll be all right – now. He left a packet fOr you. There it is!’
FrOdO toOk the envelOpe frOm the mantelpiece, and glanced at it, but did not open it.
‘YOu’ll flnd his will and all the other dOcuments in there, I think,’ said the wizard. ‘YOu are the master Of Bag End now. And alsO, I fancy, you’ll flnd a golden ring.’
‘The ring!’ exclaimed FrOdO. ‘Has he left me that? I wOnder why. Still, it may be useful.’
‘It may, and it may not,’ said Gandalf. ‘I shOuld not make use of it, if I were you. But keep it secret, and keep it safe! NOw I am going to bed.’
*       *        *
 
As master Of Bag End FrOdO felt it his painful duty to say goOd-bye to the guests. RumOurs Of strange events had by now spread all Over the fleld, but FrOdO wOuld Only say no doubt everything will be cleared up in the morning. AbOut mid-
 
night carriages came
 
fOr
 
the
 
impOrtant
 
fOlk.
 
One by one
 
they rOlled away, fllled with full but very unsatisfled hObbits.
 
Gardeners came by arrangement, and
 
remOved
 
in  wheel-
 
barrOws thOse that had inadvertently remained behind.
Night slOwly passed. The sun rOse. The hObbits rOse rather later. MOrning went on. People came and began (by orders) to clear away the paviliOns and the tables and the chairs, and the spOOns and knives and bOttles and plates, and the lanterns,
 
and the
 
ﬂOwering
 
shrubs in
 
bOxes,
 
and  the  crumbs  and
 
cracker-paper, the fOrgotten bags and glOves and handker- chiefs, and the uneaten fOOd (a very small item). Then a number Of Other people came (withOut orders): Bagginses, and BOfflns, and BOlgers, and TOOks, and Other guests that lived Or were staying near. By mid-day, when even the best- fed were out and abOut again, there was a large crOwd at Bag End, uninvited but not unexpected.
FrOdO was waiting on the step, smiling, but lOOking rather tired and wOrried. He welcOmed all the callers, but he had not much mOre to say than befOre. His reply to all inquiries was simply this: ‘Mr. BilbO Baggins has gone away; as far as I know, fOr goOd.’ SOme of the visitors he invited to cOme inside, as BilbO had left ‘messages’ fOr them.
Inside in the hall there was piled a large assOrtment of
packages and parcels and small articles Of furniture. On every item there was a label tied. There were several labels Of this sOrt:
For ADELARD TOOK, for his VERY OWN, from Bilbo; On an umbrella. Adelard had carried Off many unlabelled Ones.
For DORA BAGGINS in memory of a LONG correspon- dence, with love from Bilbo; On a large waste-paper basket. DOra was DrOgo’s sister and the eldest surviving female rela- tive of BilbO and FrOdO; she was ninety-nine, and had written reams Of goOd advice fOr mOre than half a century.
 
For MILO BURROWS, hoping it will be useful, from B.B.; On a gold pen and ink-bOttle. MilO never answered letters.
For ANGELICA’S use, from Uncle Bilbo; On a rOund cOnvex mirrOr. She was a young Baggins, and toO ObviOusly cOn- sidered her face shapely.
For the collection of HUGO BRACEGIRDLE, from a con- tributor; On an (empty) bOOk-case. Hugo was a great bOrrOwer Of bOOks, and wOrse than usual at returning them.
For LOBELIA SACKVILLE-BAGGINS, as a PRESENT;
 
On  a  case  of  silver
 
spOOns.
 
BilbO
 
believed that she had
 
acquired a goOd many of his spOOns, while he was away on his fOrmer jOurney. LObelia knew that quite well. When she arrived later in the day, she toOk the pOint at once, but she alsO toOk the spOOns.

This is Only a small selectiOn of the assembled presents. BilbO’s residence had got rather cluttered up with things in the cOurse of his lOng life. It was a tendency of hObbit-hOles to get cluttered up: fOr which the custom Of giving sO many
 
birthday-presents  was  largely
 
respOnsible.
 
NOt, Of
 
cOurse,
 
that the birthday-presents were always new; there were one Or twO Old mathoms Of fOrgotten uses that had circulated all arOund the district; but BilbO had usually given new presents, and kept thOse that he received. The old hOle was now being cleared a little.
Every one of the variOus parting gifts had labels, written Out persOnally by BilbO, and several had sOme pOint, Or sOme jOke. But, Of cOurse, mOst of the things were given where they wOuld be wanted and welcOme. The pOOrer hObbits, and especially thOse of BagshOt ROw, did very well. Old Gaffer Gamgee got twO sacks Of pOtatoes, a new spade, a wOOllen waistcOat, and a bOttle of Ointment fOr creaking jOints. Old ROry Brandybuck, in return fOr much hOspitality, got a dOzen bOttles Of Old Winyards: a strOng red wine frOm the SOuth- farthing, and now quite mature, as it had been laid dOwn by BilbO’s father. ROry quite fOrgave BilbO, and vOted him a capital fellOw after the flrst bOttle.
 
There was plenty of everything left fOr FrOdO. And, Of cOurse, all the chief treasures, as well as the bOOks, pictures, and mOre than enough furniture, were left in his pOssessiOn. There was, hOwever, no sign nor mentiOn of mOney or jewel- lery: not a penny-piece or a glass bead was given away.

FrOdO had a very trying time that afternoOn. A false rumOur that the whOle hOusehOld was being distributed free spread
 
like wildflre; and
 
befOre
 
lOng
 
the  place  was  packed  with
 
people whO had no business there, but cOuld not be kept out. Labels got torn off and mixed, and quarrels brOke out. SOme people tried to dO swaps and deals in the hall; and Others tried to make off with minor items not addressed to them, Or with anything that seemed unwanted Or unwatched. The rOad to the gate was blOcked with barrOws and handcarts.
In the middle of the cOmmOtiOn the Sackville-Bagginses
 
arrived.
 
FrOdO
 
had retired
 
fOr
 
a while and left his friend
 
Merry Brandybuck to keep an eye on things. When OthO lOudly demanded to see FrOdO, Merry bOwed pOlitely.
‘He is indispOsed,’ he said. ‘He is resting.’
‘Hiding, you mean,’ said LObelia. ‘Anyway we want to see him and we mean to see him. Just go and tell him sO!’
Merry left them a lOng while in the hall, and they had time to discOver their parting gift of spOOns. It did not imprOve their tempers. Eventually they were shOwn into the study. FrOdO was sitting at a table with a lOt of papers in frOnt of him. He lOOked indispOsed – to see Sackville-Bagginses at any rate; and he stoOd up, fldgeting with sOmething in his pOcket. But he spOke quite pOlitely.
The Sackville-Bagginses were rather Offensive. They began by offering him bad bargain-prices (as between friends) fOr variOus valuable and unlabelled things. When FrOdO replied that only the things specially directed by BilbO were being given away, they said the whOle affair was very flshy.
‘Only one thing is clear to me,’ said OthO, ‘and that is that you are dOing exceedingly well Out of it. I insist on seeing the will.’
 
OthO wOuld have been BilbO’s heir, but fOr the adOptiOn
Of  FrOdO.  He  read  the  will  carefully  and  snorted.  It  was,
unfOrtunately, very clear and cOrrect (accOrding to the legal customs Of hObbits, which demand amOng other things seven signatures Of witnesses in red ink).
‘FOiled again!’ he said to his wife. ‘And after waiting sixty years. SpOOns? Fiddlesticks!’ He snapped his flngers under FrOdO’s nose and stumped Off. But LObelia was not sO easily got rid Of. A little later FrOdO came out of the study to see hOw things were going on, and fOund her still abOut the place, investigating noOks and cOrners, and tapping the ﬂOOrs. He escOrted her flrmly off the premises, after he had relieved her Of several small (but rather valuable) articles that had sOmehOw fallen inside her umbrella. Her face lOOked as if she was in the thrOes Of thinking out a really crushing parting remark; but all she fOund to say, turning rOund On the step, was:
‘YOu’ll live to regret it, young fellOw! Why didn’t you go toO? YOu dOn’t belOng here; you’re no Baggins – you – you’re a Brandybuck!’
‘Did you hear that, Merry? That was an insult, if you like,’ said FrOdO as he shut the dOOr On her.
‘It was a cOmpliment,’ said Merry Brandybuck, ‘and sO, Of cOurse, not true.’

Then they went rOund the hOle, and evicted three young hObbits (twO BOfflns and a BOlger) whO were knocking hOles in the walls Of One of the cellars. FrOdO alsO had a tussle with young SanchO PrOudfOOt (Old OdO PrOudfOOt’s grandsOn), whO had begun an excavatiOn in the larger pantry, where he thOught there was an echO. The legend Of BilbO’s gold excited bOth curiOsity and hOpe; fOr legendary gold (mysteriOusly Obtained, if not pOsitively ill-gotten), is, as everyone knows, anyone’s fOr the flnding – unless the search is interrupted.
 
When he had
 
OvercOme
 
SanchO
 
and pushed him
 
Out,
 
FrOdO cOllapsed On a chair in the hall. ‘It’s time to clOse the shOp, Merry,’ he said. ‘LOck the dOOr, and dOn’t open it to
 
anyone today, not even if they bring a battering ram.’ Then he went to revive himself with a belated cup Of tea.
He had hardly sat dOwn, when there came a sOft knock at the frOnt-dOOr. ‘LObelia again mOst likely,’ he thOught. ‘She must have thOught of sOmething really nasty, and have cOme back again to say it. It can wait.’
He went on with his tea. The knock was repeated, much lOuder, but he toOk no notice. Suddenly the wizard’s head appeared at the windOw.
‘If you dOn’t let me in, FrOdO, I shall blOw your dOOr right dOwn your hOle and Out thrOugh the hill,’ he said.
‘My dear Gandalf! Half a minute!’ cried  FrOdO, running Out of the rOOm to the dOOr. ‘COme in! COme in! I thOught it was LObelia.’
‘Then I fOrgive you. But I saw her sOme time ago, driving a pOny-trap towards Bywater with a face that wOuld have curdled new milk.’
 
‘She had already nearly curdled me.
 
HOnestly,
 
I  nearly
 
tried On BilbO’s ring. I lOnged to disappear.’
‘DOn’t dO that!’ said Gandalf, sitting dOwn. ‘DO be careful Of that ring, FrOdO! In fact, it is partly abOut that that I have cOme to say a last wOrd.’
‘Well, what abOut it?’
‘What dO you know already?’
‘Only what BilbO told me. I have heard his story: hOw he fOund it, and hOw he used it: On his jOurney, I mean.’
‘Which story, I wOnder,’ said Gandalf.
‘Oh, not what he told the dwarves and put in his bOOk,’ said FrOdO. ‘He told me the true story sOOn after I came to live here. He said you had pestered him till he told
 
you,
 
sO I had better know
 
toO.
 
‘‘NO
 
secrets between us,
 
FrOdO,’’ he said; ‘‘but they are not to go any further. It’s mine anyway.’’ ’
‘That’s interesting,’ said Gandalf. ‘Well, what did you think Of it all?’
‘If you mean, inventing all that abOut a ‘‘present’’, well, I thOught the true story much mOre likely, and I cOuldn’t see
 
the pOint of altering it at all. It was very unlike BilbO to dO sO, anyway; and I thOught it rather Odd.’
‘SO did I. But odd things may happen to people that have such treasures – if they use them. Let it be a warning to you to be very careful with it. It may have other pOwers than just making you vanish when you wish to.’
‘I dOn’t understand,’ said FrOdO.
‘Neither dO I,’ answered the wizard. ‘I have merely begun to wOnder abOut the ring, especially since last night. NO need
to wOrry. But if you take my advice you will use it very
seldOm, Or not at all. At least I beg you not to use it  in any way that will cause talk Or rOuse suspiciOn. I say again: keep it safe, and keep it secret!’
‘YOu are very mysteriOus! What are you afraid Of ?’
‘I am not certain, sO I will say no mOre. I may be able to tell you sOmething when I cOme back. I am going off at once: sO this is goOd-bye fOr the present.’ He got up.
‘At once!’ cried FrOdO. ‘Why, I thOught you were staying On fOr at least a week. I was lOOking fOrward to your help.’
‘I did mean to – but I have had to change my mind. I may be away fOr a goOd while; but I’ll cOme and see you again, as sOOn as I can. Expect me when you see me! I shall slip in quietly. I shan’t often be visiting the Shire openly again. I flnd that I have becOme rather unpOpular. They say I am a nuisance and a disturber Of the peace. SOme people are actu- ally accusing me of spiriting BilbO away, Or wOrse. If you want to know, there is suppOsed to be a plOt between you and me to get hOld Of his wealth.’
 
‘SOme
 
people!’ exclaimed
 
FrOdO.
 
‘YOu
 
mean
 
OthO
 
and
 
LObelia. HOw abOminable! I wOuld give them Bag End and everything else, if I cOuld get BilbO back and go Off tramping in the cOuntry with him. I lOve the Shire. But I begin to wish, sOmehOw, that I had gone toO. I wOnder if I shall ever see him again.’
‘SO dO I,’ said Gandalf. ‘And I wOnder many other things.
 
GOOd-bye
 
now! Take care of yourself !
 
LOOk
 
Out
 
fOr
 
me,
 
especially at unlikely times! GOOd-bye!’
 
FrOdO saw him to the dOOr. He gave a flnal wave of his hand, and walked Off at a surprising pace; but FrOdO thOught the old wizard lOOked unusually bent, almOst as if he was carrying a great weight. The evening was clOsing in, and his clOaked flgure quickly vanished into the twilight. FrOdO did not see him again fOr a lOng time.
